# 3 Employment of Modules

From the previous chapter, the guide thoroughly explains how to import R packages using `box::use()`, which is the original concept, and why it is such convenient in having more control on how you attach the package, between bulky and granular imports, and how **{box}** absolves namespace conflicts in the current environment.

For this chapter will dive deeper into the creation, organization, and reuse of modules using **{box}**, one of its core strengths. By structuring your code into reusable modules, you can make your R projects more manageable, scalable, and maintainable.

One of the core strengths of **{box}** is its ability to help you create reusable modules. This chapter will show you how to create, organize, and use modules effectively in your R projects.

## Module Basics

In **{box}**, a module is simply an R script or a folder that contains an R script that encapsulates related functions, variables, and objects, forming a cohesive unit of functionality. Think of a module as a container of reusable code, similar to how Python packages work. This design encourages a modular programming approach, where you organize your code into logically separated units, making it easy to maintain and reuse across different projects.
